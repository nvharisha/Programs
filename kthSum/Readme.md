Problem:
Given an array of intervals arr[] of size N, the task is to find the Kth smallest element among all the elements within the intervals of the given array.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {{5, 11}, {10, 15}, {12, 20}}, K =12
Output: 13
Explanation:Elements in the given array of intervals are: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}.
Therefore, the Kth(=12th) smallest element is 13.

Input: arr[] = {{5, 11}, {10, 15}, {12, 20}}, K = 7
Output:10
